# hw16-workout-tracker

A simple fitness routine tracking application, accepting user input of either cardio or resistance exercises.

Users add an exercise by first choosing one of the two types. If they select 'Resistance,' users can enter an exercise name, weight, sets, repetitions, and duration in minutes. Users can enter an exercise name, distance in iles, and duration if they choose 'cardio.'

Information persists from session to session, and a handy tracking dashboard tracks information from the previous seven days.
